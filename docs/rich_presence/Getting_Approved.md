# Getting Approved for Spectate

> info
> Ask to Join no longer requires whitelisting or approval. Everyone has access to it, and Ask to Join requests are now automatically handled within the Discord overlay. Enjoy!

For the majority of Rich Presence, we do not require any sort of approval or whitelisting. You are free to update presence data and create join and spectate chat invites without us looking it over. However, if you want to add the “Spectate” button on your players’ profiles, we want to take a look first and ensure that you get any support you might need.

You’ll need to have the following prepared for the approval process:

- A video demonstrating your integration of the feature

These submissions should be in a polished, finalized state rather than works in progress.

## Spectate Video

If your game supports spectating, you probably want to apply for our Spectate feature as well! This displays a button on your players’ profiles that allows their friends to easily spectate their game. Clicking the button will launch the game client into its specific spectate mode. Here’s an example!

To be approved for Spectate, submit a video of your game’s Spectate flow that looks something like the above example. Specifically, we want to see:

#### Player

- Clicks Spectate on a friend’s profile
- Game client launches
- Begin spectating friend

In the case of spectating, your players should not be able to join the game directly. If you want players to be able to join a game session, use our Ask to Join feature instead. Discord’s Spectate feature is limited to a “true spectate” experience—that means no joining on.

To test Spectate for your game, you can add whitelisted users on [your app's developer dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) who will then have the feature enabled on their profile.
