# Vanity Perks

If you're a Verified Server on Discord, you get access to a suite of server customization features to help make your server stand out and feel all cozy and comfortable for your players. We've outline all those features below for you, including some best practices to help you put your best foot forward.

## Server Banner Background

The Server Banner Background is a new addition to the server customization toolbox. Along with the oh-so-coveted Verified Check Mark, you can now show off a banner at the top of the channel list in your server. This can be managed in your server settings in the Discord app.

We like to continually improve and polish the features we release and have decided to retire the Server Banner Background (RIP 2019 - 2019) and introduce a new version of the server banner called Server Banner Background (same name, just like the soft reboot of the 1980’s movie Total Recall).

#### Previous Design

The first iteration fo the banner background had the title at the bottom of the image. In the newest version of the design, we’ve moved the name of the server back to the top. In order to help with this change, we had the design team put together some guidelines for best results.

#### Best Practices

_Upload an image that's at least 960x540 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio._ Have a 1920x1080 image handy? Upload that and we'll automatically resize it for you.

_Keep the top 48px of the image fairly simple and free of any busy imagery._ We'd suggest uploading an image without a logo or text in it. This way, the title of your server will be easy to read.

_Use an image that represents your game or brand._ Key art, stills of a character, or subtle background art work well here. Here's a great example from our good friend Master Chief:

You did it! Lookin' good there.
