# Change Log

## Changes to Special Channels

#### August 22, 2019

News Channels are now changed to [Announcement Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/announcement-channels). Developer License owners will continue to get access to them (both existing and new). Underlying channel type (GUILD_NEWS = 5) remains the same. 

## More Precise Rate Limits

#### August 12, 2019

You can now get more precise rate limit reset times, via a new request header. Check out the [rate limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/more-precise-rate-limit-resets) documentation for more information.

## Bot Tokens for Achievements

#### July 18, 2019

You can now use Bot tokens for authorization headers against the HTTP API for [Achievements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/the-api-way).

## Additional Team Information

#### June 19, 2019

Additional information around Teams has been added to both the API and the documentation. The [Teams](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/api-stuff) page now includes information about the team and team member objects. Additionally, the [Get Current Application Information](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/get-current-application-information) endpoint now returns a `team` object if that application belongs to a team. That documentation has also been updated to includes fields that were missing for applications that are games sold on Discord.

## Added Info Around Nitro Boosting Experiment

#### May 29, 2019

Additional information has been documented to support [Server Nitro Boosting](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting). This includes the addition of a few [message types](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types), as well as some [new fields on guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object-premium-tier). Please note that this feature is currently under experimentation, and these fields may be subject to change.

## Deprecation of Discord-RPC Rich Presence SDK

#### April 29, 2019

The [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc) implementation of Rich Presence has been deprecated in favor of Discord's new GameSDK. If you're interested in using Rich Presence, please read our [SDK Starter Guide](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/) and check out the relevant functions in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/).

## New Invite Object Fields

#### April 18, 2019

The [Invite Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/invite-object) now includes two additional fields, `target_user` and `target_user_type`.

## Ask to Join & Rich Presence SDK

#### January 14, 2019

Ask to Join no longer requires approval or whitelisting to use. You are welcome to create in-game UI, but all Ask to Join requests are also now handled by the Discord overlay.

There have also been some small additions to the Rich Presence SDK. The previously undocumented `UpdateHandlers()` function is now documented.

## Documentation: Dispatch Store Listings

#### December 11, 2018

Dispatch documentation around store listings has been removed. Store pages for the Discord Store are now managed entirely within the [Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers).

## Enhancement: User Object

#### November 30, 2018

The [User object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) now includes two new additional fields, `premium_type` and `flags`. These can be used to know the Nitro status of a user, or determine which HypeSquad house a user is in.

## Documentation Fix: List of Open DMS in Certain Payloads

#### June 19, 2018

The documentation has been updated to correctly note that the `private_channels` field in the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) should be an empty array, as well as the response from `/users/@me/channels` for a bot user. This change has been in effect for a long time, but the documentation was not updated.

## Deprecation: RPC online member count and members list

#### June 11, 2018

We released server changes that allow guilds to represent an incomplete state of the member list in our clients, which results in inaccurate member lists and online counts over RPC. These fields are now deprecated and will now return an empty members array and an online count of 0 moving forward.

## Enhancement: New Message Properties

#### February 5, 2018

Additional `activity` and `application` fields—as well as corresponding object documentation—have been added to the [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object in support of our newly-released [Spotify integration](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-Discord-Spotify-Connection) and previous Rich Presence enhancements.

## Enhancement: Get Guild Emoji Endpoint

#### January 30, 2018

The [Get Guild Emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/get-guild-emoji) response now also includes a user object if the emoji was added by a user.

## Deprecation: Accept Invite Endpoint

#### January 23, 2018

The [Accept Invite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/accept-invite) endpoint is deprecated starting today, and will be discontinued on March 23, 2018. The [Add Guild Member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint should be used in its place.

## Semi-Breaking Change: Very Large Bot Sharding

#### January 3, 2018

Additional sharding requirements and information for bots in over 100,000 guilds has been added. This requires a small change in numbers of shards for affected bots. See the [documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding-for-very-large-bots) for more information.

## New Feature: Rich Presence

#### November 9, 2017

Rich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:

- Showing more information about a user's current game in their profile
- Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat
- Displaying "Spectate" and "Ask to Join" buttons on users' profiles

For more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/)!

## Breaking Change: API & Gateway Below v6 Discontinued

#### October 16, 2017

[API](#DOCS_REFERENCE/api-versioning) and [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-protocol-versions) versions below v6 are now discontinued after being previously deprecated. Version 6 is now the default API and Gateway version. Attempting to use a version below 6 will result in an error.

## New Feature: Channel Categories

#### September 20, 2017

Changes have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-obect) object and a new [channel category example](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-example-channel-category).

## New Feature: Emoji Endpoints

#### September 10, 2017

[Emoji endpoints](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-resource) have been added to the API. Bots can now manage guild emojis to their robo-hearts' content!

## Breaking Change: Presence Activity Objects

#### August 16, 2017

The `type` field in the [activity object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) for [Gateway Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status) and [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) payloads is no longer optional when the activity object is not null.

## Breaking Change: Default Channels

#### August 3, 2017

After today, we are changing how default channels function. The "default" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.

We saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.

We are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild's default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited.

## New Feature: Audit Logs

#### July 24, 2017

Audit logs are here! Well, they've been here all along, but now we've got [documentation](#DOCS_AUDIT_LOG/audit-logs) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.

## Breaking Change: Version 6

#### July 19, 2017

- [Channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) Object
  - `is_private` removed
  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) is now an integer
  - `recipient` is now `recipients`, an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects
- [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) Object
  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types) added to support system messages
- [Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-status-gateway-status-update-structure) Object
  - `idle_since` renamed to `since`
